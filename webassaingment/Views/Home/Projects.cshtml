                        Library management using Java involves designing and implementing a system to efficiently organize, catalog, and manage library resources. In Java,
                        object-oriented programming (OOP) principles can be applied to create classes and objects that represent books, patrons, transactions, and other elements
                        of a library. Through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, a Java-based library management system can provide a robust and modular solution for tasks
                        such as adding new books, tracking loans, and generating reports.

                        Hotel management using C# .NET involves developing a Windows Forms application to efficiently handle various aspects of hotel operations.
                        The application can utilize C# for backend logic and .NET Forms for creating a user-friendly interface. Object-oriented programming
                        principles can be applied to design classes representing different entities such as rooms, guests, reservations, and staff. The application
                        include features like room booking, guest check-in/check-out, billing, and reporting, providing a comprehensive solution for hotel management.
